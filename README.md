# react-portfolio
A portfolio page of my work I built using react. I maintain it as a showcase for my projects.

## Website Organization
This pages's structure is entirely front end and follows the basic organization the "create-react-app" produces.

### Public
These include the index file that is directly displayed by the browser and the robots.txt file, which determines which files web robots can access.

### Source
These are the React files that drive the experience.
